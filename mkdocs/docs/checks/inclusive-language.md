# Inclusive Language

## Description

This validation check looks for language that could be considered non-inclusive / biased.

!!! note
    Some terms have alternate terms suggestions, while others are simply marked as potentially biased. It's up to the draft authors and RPC staff to determine whether a term should be left as-is or find a better suited alternative.
