# Names

## Description

This validation check looks for author names that could be mispelled or not using an author's preferred name.

!!! note
    This check requires internet access to fetch the latest list. It is cached on subsequent runs.

    A match doesn't automatically signify an error, but is simply to warn the user to verify whether the name is used properly.
